how many 'r's are there in strawberry?
<think>
To determine how many 'r's are in the word "strawberry," I will examine each letter individually. 

First, I'll note that "strawberry" consists of 10 letters. 

Next, I'll identify each letter and check if it is an 'r.' 

After reviewing all the letters, I will count the number of 'r's present in the word.
